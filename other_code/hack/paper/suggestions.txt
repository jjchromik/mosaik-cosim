fehlerkorrektur:
To prevent manipulated sensor information from leading to an insecure state, the IDS also validates sensor values with a behaviour specification based approach inspired by rules based on physical information as proposed in [1] and [4].
This prevents the overall size of the data from blowing up.
This attack increases the current of branch_2 and branch_4 by 1 per cent each simulation step which is similar to the attack in (fig. ??). In (fig. 5) this continuous increase can be seen as a steady rising of the black and red graph.
As a conclusion we consider neither deterministic nor random attacks to be sufficient enough to harm the grid without the IDS noticing

vllt einfach schreiben wie sie relaten anstatt das so zu formulieren:
Topology 3a relates to topology 3 similar to how topology 1a relates to topology 1.

ist das disables/enables so ok?
Furthermore, RTUs are capable of closing and opening the switch of a branch which disables/enables the flow of electricity for the bra

Verbesserung:
At the moment our IDS is rather easily tricked by gradually increasing and decreasing current values read by branch sensors on a single node in a way that Kirchhoff's Law is not violated at the node.
